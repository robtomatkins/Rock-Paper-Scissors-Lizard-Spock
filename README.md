## JavaScript Portolio Project
<br>
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock is a fun, interactive game, with an element of chance. As the player, you will face off against the computer, no skill is needed as the computer choice is selected at random through the use of JavaScript. The game is fully repsonsive, and can be accessed quicky via a mobile device if needed.

# UX

- ## Overview 
    - The site has been designed to have an ineractive, fun and non-static feel. I have aimed to create an informal deisgn feel through the use of selected font styles and bright colour scheme. 
    <br>
    Design elements run consistently throughout all three pages, such as the hero image (different image but same size), navigation bar, footer and colour scheme. The 'walks' and 'about' section both have the same layout but have different imagery for the text box backgrouds. 
<br>

- ## Colour Story 

    - #f9f5ec; Off White
    - #191919; Dark grey
    - #a7a59e; Light Grey
    - #d6543e; I obtained this colour by using the colour picker tool on the controls images - allowing me to use a consitent colour story thoughout the site.
    - #f0d2a5; I obtained this colour by using the colour picker tool on the controls images - allowing me to use a consitent colour story thoughout the site.
<br>

- ## Fonts
    - Downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I chose Mouse Memoirs for it's informal, dynamic feel, contributing to the overall game like feeling of the app. 
<br>

- ## Images
    - Images were obtained from [OPENCLIPART](https://openclipart.org/detail/325665/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock).
<br>

- ## Hover Size Increase on Controls 
    - This attribute is used to make it clear to the user which button they are pressing - it also contributes the interactive feel of the game

# Site Features

- ## [The Game Message Area](#project-screenshots) 
    - The game message area displays a message to the user once the game function has run. It will show either win, lose or draw. This provides an interactive element and contributes to the game feeling of the app. 
    <br>
    <br>
